# Integration Proxy

An integration proxy is a reverse proxy that transforms responses (headers and bodies) to emulate an integrated environment in a local [Express](http://expressjs.com/) server.

As a front-end web developer, you want to build and test your static assets in a context that mostly closely matches the environment to which they will eventually be deployed.

Traditional solutions to this problem involve either cloning the integrated environment and running it locally or transferring files via Samba or FTP. But all too often, cloning environments is too complex, and transferring files is too slow.

By running an integration proxy as part of your Node-based development stack, you can keep changes in your local working copy until they are ready, and then you can deploy them when they are complete.
